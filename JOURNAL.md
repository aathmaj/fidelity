This took wayyy too much time.....

Completed phase 1 of research on how to make the hardware. I decided on a custom pcb combined with a raspberry pi pico W. The main modules on the project will be:

**MODULE A**

COMPONENT 1: USB-C Connector
COMPONENT 2: Charger IC and LDO Regulator (regulate voltage) 
COMPONENT 3: Raspberry Pi Pico W (all processing)

**MODULE B**

COMPONENT 1: I2S (digital to analog)
COMPONENT 2: SD Card Reader

COMPONENT 3: TFT Display
COMPONENT 4: Buttons and encoders
